Nice work!

I took into account that the add method has the problem we discussed.
Since you use that for many of your other methods, I also accounted for
that situation in all the other output.  I gave you 0.5 for each of the
division and remaindering, since you wrote code, but it isn't actually
implemented -- I got the "operation not yet supported" exception, but I
wanted to give you credit for writing the code.

Pay attention to your coding style -- indenting a bit more and putting
more space between things improves the readability and doesn't cost you
anything.  A few spaces and linefeeds in the code really doesn't matter
to the compiler, but makes it MUCH easier for humans to read.

If you have any questions, let me know.
